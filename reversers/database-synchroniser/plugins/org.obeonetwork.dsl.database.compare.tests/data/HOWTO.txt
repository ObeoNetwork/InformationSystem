* Create the 'right' database model in IS Designer/Safr@n Studio
* Copy it as the 'left' database model and modify it
* Compare it in the development environment  => This is the 'expected' for comparison and input for transformation
* Compare it in IS Designer/Safr@n Studio    => This is the 'expected' for transformation
* URIs in (at least) compare.xmi should be related and not in platform:/resource
* Sometimes matches are not reproduced exactly so what was expected to be a single change is actually a deletion, 
creation and change so you may need to manually modify comparison.xmi to replace it with what is obtained at runtime.
Same afterwards for dbevolution.xmi.
