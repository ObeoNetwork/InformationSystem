  title: Obeo Designer Team Server - Administration Server
  description: |
    This guide describe the REST API of the administration server for Obeo Designer Team Server. This API will allow you to manage CDO repositories, shared modeling projects and depending on the type of repository you manage, you will be able to manager the repository users. If you already have configured the [administration server](../Obeo_Designer_Team_Administration_Server.html) for Obeo Designer Team Server you can start to use our API.

    Remark: The protocol, host and port can be different from your server configuration.

    In this documentation we will use the web service API in the version **v1.0**.

    **Disclaimer:** As basic authentication is enabled for the administration server, the _Authorization_ header must be added in all requests with the base64 encoded credentials.

        This request will allow you to creates a repository.
        The body of the request take a JSON object with the following parameters: *repositoryName*, *authenticationType* and *datasourceType* which are mandatory and also *authenticationData* and *datasourceData* which are optional.

        While the *authenticationType* value can be empty, the *repositoryName* and the *datasourceType* values cannot.

        By default you can use the following values to manage your repositories:
          * *authenticationType* can take:
            * an empty value
            * LDAP
            * FILE
            * LDAP_FILE
            * USERPROFILE
            * LDAP_USERPROFILE
          * *datasourceType* can take:
            * H2_EMBEDDED
            * H2_SERVER

        You can also contribute your own extensions and use the key value of your extension as described in the Administration Server [documentation](../Obeo_Designer_Team_Administration_Server.html#Contribute_administration_server).

        Those values describe how your repository will manage authentication and database.

        As the optional parameters (*authenticationData* and *datasourceDat*) depends on the mandatory parameters, we will use examples to describe how to use them.

        The repository is started after its creation and lifecycle hooks are called before and after its start.

        The body of the request take two parameters: *needsEncryption* which is mandatory and *password* which is optional but needed if *needsEncryption* is set to true.

        As the export of the database can take time, the web service will schedule an asynchronous job and return the link where you will be able to download the file in the response under the *url* attribute.

        If *needsEncryption* is set to false the export of the database will create an xml file representing the CDO database in the *export* folder which can be configured in the properties files of the Administration Server as described in [Administration Server configuration](../Obeo_Designer_Team_Administration_Server.html#Webservice_configuration). If *needsEncryption* is set to true then an encrypted zip file containing the xml file will be created instead.

        This file must be a backup of the database.

        As this API needs a file, we suggest you to use the input file of your favorite browser in order to let it set the correct headers for the upload of the file.
        As the import of the database can take time, the web service will schedule an asynchronous job.

        The state (ONLINE | OFFLINE) of the repository will be the same after the import as before the import.

        Static repositories are not managed.
