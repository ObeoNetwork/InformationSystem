		<h1 id="ObeoNetworkUsingmodelingprojectsaslibraries">Obeo Network &#8211; Using modeling projects as libraries</h1>
		<p>Since 1.8 version IS Designer allows one to export a modeling project as a library file (a MAR file) and import it into another modeling project.</p>
		<p>This can be useful when one wants to model core concepts inside a core project and then use these core concepts in another modeling project without modifying the initial project.  </p>
		<p>When exporting a modeling project as a library file (typically with 
			<em>.mar</em> extension) one can set a version number corresponding to the exported data. This version number is checked when importing the library into another modeling project.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Exportamodelingprojectasalibrary">Export a modeling project as a library</h2>
		<p>To export a modeling project as a library, use the 
			<em>File &gt; Export...</em> menu and choose 
			<em>Export modeling project as library</em> in 
			<em>IS Designer</em> category.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/ExportMenu.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>On the wizard&#8217;s first page, the user can select the project to be exported and the destination for the generated MAR file.
			<br/>The destinatin file can be located inside or outside an eclipse project. The recommended way is to use an external location.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/exportWizardPage1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>On the wizard&#8217;s next page, the user can define the following information :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Project ID</strong> The default value is the name of the exported project. (required)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Version</strong> The version number must be in the form x.y.z where x,y and z are integers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Previous version</strong> This table is not editable. It presents the previous versions that were exported from the same modeling project.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Comment</strong>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/exportWizardPage2.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once this last step is completed, a MAR file is generated at the specified location .This file can then be imported into another modeling project.</p>
		<h2 id="Importalibraryintoamodelingproject">Import a library into a modeling project</h2>
		<p>To import a library file into a modeling project, use the 
			<em>File &gt; Import...</em> menu and choose 
			<em>Export library into modeling project</em> in 
			<em>IS Designer</em> category.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importMenu.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>On the wizard&#8217;s page, the user can define :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the target project. The project is already selected if the user launched the import from a selected project.</li>
			<li>the MAR file to import</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importWizard.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once the MAR file has been selected, informations are extracted from the file and displayed to the user :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Project ID</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Version</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Creation date</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Comment</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dependencies</strong> In this table, the dependencies found in the MAR file are displayed with a green or red tick to indicate if the dependency is valid regarding the target project.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If all dependencies are valid, the user can finish the wizard. The file is then imported into the 
			<em>libraries</em> folder in the target project.
			<br/>A folder with the name and ID of the imported project is created. All semantic and graphical data are copied into this folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importedLibrary.png"/>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Notesaboutdependencies">Notes about dependencies</h2>
		<p>When importing a MAR file a dependencies table is displayed :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the main project that was exported in the MAR file. A check against the version is done if this project had already been imported.</li>
			<li>the projects that were imported in this main project before the MAR file was created. A check against the version is done in case these projects had been already imported into the target project either directly or by importing another project.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let&#8217;s illustrate this with an example.</p>

		</p>
		<p>A

		<p>A 
			<em>libraries</em> folder has been created and a folder for 
			<em>Project 1</em> V1.0.0 has been created too.
			<br/>Inside the 
			<em>Project 1-1.0.0</em> we can see a 
			<em>libraries</em> folder for the previously imported 
			<em>Core project</em>.
