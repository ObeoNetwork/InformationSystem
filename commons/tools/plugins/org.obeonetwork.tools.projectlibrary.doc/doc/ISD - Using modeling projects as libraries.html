<h1 id="isd---using-modeling-projects-as-libraries">ISD - Using modeling projects as libraries</h1>
<p>Since IS Designer 1.8.</p>
<p>Allows to export a modeling project as a library file and import it into other modeling projects.</p>
<p>When a library is exported, the user chooses a version number. This version number is checked when importing the library into another modeling project. References to elements contained in the library are updated automatically.</p>
<p>This is useful to reuse modeling libraries among different projects, keeping track of the versions.</p>
<p>The library files have the .mar extension (standing for Modeling ARchive).</p>
<h2 id="export-a-modeling-project-as-a-library">Export a modeling project as a library</h2>
<p>To export a modeling project as a library, use the <em>File &gt; Export…</em> menu and choose <em>Export modeling project as library</em> in <em>IS Designer</em> category.</p>
<p><img src="pics/ExportMenu.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The wizard’s first page allows to define the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modeling Project</strong> The project to be exported. Already selected if the user launched the import from a selected project.</li>
<li><strong>Export directory</strong> The destination folder. Can be located inside or outside an Eclipse project. The recommended way is to use an external location.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="pics/exportWizardPage1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The second page allows to define the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project ID</strong> The default value is the name of the exported project. (required)</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong> The version number of the library. Must be in the form M.m.p.qualifier where M, m and p are integers.</li>
<li><strong>Previous version</strong> A read only table is showing the previous versions that were exported from the same modeling project.</li>
<li><strong>Comment</strong> A description of the library version.</li>
<li><strong>MAR filename</strong> The library filename (ending with the .mar file extension). This value is recomputed when the Project ID or version is changed but can still be overridden if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Update referencing projects</strong> The modeling projects that have cross-references to the exported project. The selected projects will import the library produced by the current export and the cross-references will be redirected to the library. Details on importing a library are described in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="pics/exportWizardPage2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the wizard is completed, a MAR file is generated at the specified location. This file can then be imported into another modeling project.</p>
<h2 id="import-a-library-into-a-modeling-project">Import a library into a modeling project</h2>
<p>To import a library file into a modeling project, use the <em>File &gt; Import…</em> menu and choose <em>Import library into modeling project</em> in <em>IS Designer</em> category.</p>
<p><img src="pics/importMenu.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The wizard allows to define :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modeling project</strong> The target project. Already selected if the import was launched from a selected project.</li>
<li><strong>Import file</strong> The MAR file to import</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="pics/importWizard.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once the MAR file has been selected, the following information are extracted from the file and displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project ID</strong></li>
<li><strong>Version</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creation date</strong></li>
<li><strong>Comment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong> The dependencies found in the MAR file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependencies are displayed with a green or red tick indicating if the dependency is valid or not regarding the target project.<br />
If all dependencies are valid, the user can finish the wizard. The file is then imported into a <em>libraries</em> folder in the target project.<br />
A folder with the name and ID of the imported project is created. All semantic and graphical data are copied into this folder.</p>
<p><img src="pics/importedLibrary.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="notes-about-dependencies">Notes about dependencies</h2>
<p>When importing a MAR file the dependencies table shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the main project that was exported in the MAR file. A check against the version is done if this project had already been imported.</li>
<li>the projects that were imported in this main project before the MAR file was created. A check against the version is done in case these projects had been already imported into the target project either directly or by importing another project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an illustrative example :</p>
<h4 id="initial-before-export">Initial <Core project> before export</h4>
<p><img src="pics/coreProject.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="initial-target-project-project-1">Initial target project &lt;Project 1&gt;</h4>
<p><img src="pics/initialProject1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="project-1-after-importing">&lt;Project 1&gt; after importing <Core project></h4>
<p><img src="pics/importedLibrary.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <em>libraries</em> folder has been created and a folder for <em>Core project</em> V1.0.0 has been created too.</p>
<h4 id="initial-target-project-project-2">Initial target project &lt;Project 2&gt;</h4>
<p><img src="pics/initialProject2.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="project-2-after-importing-project-1">&lt;Project 2&gt; after importing &lt;Project 1&gt;</h4>
<p><img src="pics/project2AfterImport.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <em>libraries</em> folder has been created and a folder for <em>Project 1</em> V1.0.0 has been created too.<br />
Inside the <em>Project 1-1.0.0</em> we can see a <em>libraries</em> folder for the previously imported <em>Core project</em>.</p>
