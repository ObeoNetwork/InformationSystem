		<h1 id="ISDUsingmodelingprojectsaslibraries">ISD &#8211; Using modeling projects as libraries</h1>
		<p>Since IS Designer 1.8.</p>
		<p>Allows to export a modeling project as a library file and import it into other modeling projects.</p>
		<p>When a library is exported, the user chooses a version number. This version number is checked when importing the library into another modeling project. References to elements contained in the library are updated automatically.</p>
		<p>This is useful to reuse modeling libraries among different projects, keeping track of the versions.</p>
		<p>The library files have the .mar extension (standing for Modeling ARchive).</p>
		<h2 id="Exportamodelingprojectasalibrary">Export a modeling project as a library</h2>
		<p>To export a modeling project as a library, use the 
			<em>File &gt; Export...</em> menu and choose 
			<em>Export modeling project as library</em> in 
			<em>IS Designer</em> category.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>The wizard&#8217;s first page allows to define the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Modeling Project</strong> The project to be exported. Already selected if the user launched the import from a selected project.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Export directory</strong> The destination folder. Can be located inside or outside an Eclipse project. The recommended way is to use an external location.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/exportWizardPage1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The second page allows to define the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Project ID</strong> The default value is the name of the exported project. (required)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Version</strong> The version number of the library. Must be in the form M.m.p.qualifier where M, m and p are integers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Previous version</strong> A read only table is showing the previous versions that were exported from the same modeling project.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Comment</strong> A description of the library version.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>MAR filename</strong> The library filename (ending with the .mar file extension). This value is recomputed when the Project ID or version is changed but can still be overridden if necessary.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/exportWizardPage2.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>When the wizard is completed, a MAR file is generated at the specified location. This file can then be imported into another modeling project.</p>
		<h2 id="Importalibraryintoamodelingproject">Import a library into a modeling project</h2>
		<p>To import a library file into a modeling project, use the 
			<em>File &gt; Import...</em> menu and choose 
			<em>Import library into modeling project</em> in 
			<em>IS Designer</em> category.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importMenu.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The wizard allows to define :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Modeling project</strong> The target project. Already selected if the import was launched from a selected project.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Import file</strong> The MAR file to import
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importWizard.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Once the MAR file has been selected, the following information are extracted from the file and displayed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Project ID</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Version</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Creation date</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Comment</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dependencies</strong> The dependencies found in the MAR file.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The dependencies are displayed with a green or red tick indicating if the dependency is valid or not regarding the target project.
			<br/>If all dependencies are valid, the user can finish the wizard. The file is then imported into a 
			<em>libraries</em> folder in the target project.
			<br/>A folder with the name and ID of the imported project is created. All semantic and graphical data are copied into this folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importedLibrary.png"/>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Notesaboutdependencies">Notes about dependencies</h2>
		<p>When importing a MAR file the dependencies table shows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the main project that was exported in the MAR file. A check against the version is done if this project had already been imported.</li>
			<li>the projects that were imported in this main project before the MAR file was created. A check against the version is done in case these projects had been already imported into the target project either directly or by importing another project.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here is an illustrative example :</p>
		<h4 id="InitialCoreprojectbeforeexport">Initial &lt;Core project&gt; before export</h4>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/coreProject.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="InitialtargetprojectProject1">Initial target project &lt;Project 1&gt;</h4>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/initialProject1.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Project1afterimportingCoreproject">&lt;Project 1&gt; after importing &lt;Core project&gt;</h4>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/importedLibrary.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A 
			<em>libraries</em> folder has been created and a folder for 
			<em>Core project</em> V1.0.0 has been created too.
		</p>
		<h4 id="InitialtargetprojectProject2">Initial target project &lt;Project 2&gt;</h4>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/initialProject2.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Project2afterimportingProject1">&lt;Project 2&gt; after importing &lt;Project 1&gt;</h4>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="pics/project2AfterImport.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A 
			<em>libraries</em> folder has been created and a folder for 
			<em>Project 1</em> V1.0.0 has been created too.
			<br/>Inside the 
			<em>Project 1-1.0.0</em> we can see a 
			<em>libraries</em> folder for the previously imported 
			<em>Core project</em>.
