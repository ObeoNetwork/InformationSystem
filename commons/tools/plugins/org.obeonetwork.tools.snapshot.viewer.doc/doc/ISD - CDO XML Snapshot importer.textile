h1. ISD - CDO XML Snapshot Importer

A CDO server, as the one provided by Obeo Designer Team, allows one to export the contents of a repository in XML format.

A CDO XML Snapshot is not easily read. One must create a new CDO server, load the file using the _cdo export_ command. And finally locally import a project into the workspace from Obeo Designer Team.

The CDO XML Snapshot Importer can be used to do all these steps for you. You select an XML file, a project to import and the importer automatically creates the local project for you. An embedded CDO server is created and destroyed in the backstage to do this. 

h2. Create a CDO XML Snapshot

To use the importer you first need a CDO XML snapchot. To create such a snapshot, just type the following command in the CDO server console, replacing *&lt;repository-name&gt;* and *&lt;filename&gt;* with respectively the name of the repository you want to export and the path to the XML file you want to create :

bq. cdo export &lt;repository-name&gt; &lt;filename&gt;

h2. Use the importer

The importer can be launched using the _import_ menu :

bq. File... > Import... > Sirius > Import project from CDO XML snapshot

In the wizard, use _Load file..._ to select a XML snapshot file. It is then automatically loaded in a freshly created embedded CDO server.

The remote projects list is automatically filled with the contents of the repository and the first project is selected.

A local project name is suggested given the remote project name. If a project with this name already exists in workspace an error message is displayed and the wizard can not be completed until a valid local project name has been given.

Once the wizard is completed a modeling project is created in the workspace.
